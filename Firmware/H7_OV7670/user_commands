MODE_CAPTURE
  Switches the firmware into camera capture mode and restarts the DCMI/DMA pipeline if needed. Setting is stored in flash so it persists after reset.

MODE_SIMULATE
  Enables the synthetic scene generator instead of the live sensor. This flag is stored in flash so the board reboots in the same mode.

MAX_FRAMERATE=<value>
  Sets the maximum number of frames processed per second (1-120). Use 0 for unlimited. The chosen value is written to flash.

CALIBRATE
  Copies the next processed frame into the reference buffer to establish a new baseline. Executes once per command and is not stored in flash.

DATA_LOG
  Prints the running averages (last 10 frames) for DCMI capture time, depth calculation time, USB transfer time, and displaced pixel count.

DISPLACED_THRESHOLD=<value>
  Sets how many displaced pixels are required (1-76800) before the intrusion LED turns on. Stored in flash and applied immediately.

ERROR_THRESHOLD=<value>
  Adjusts the per-pixel phase-difference tolerance (0-65535) used when counting displaced pixels. Stored in flash and applies to future frames.
